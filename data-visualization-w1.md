# Data Visualization - Week 1

* 1-Data set: gapminder
* 2-Topic: *is urban population assiciated with co2 emissions*
  * wealth&growth vs efficiency
  * Interest: Energy, CO2
* 3-Code book (Variables):
  * urban population: %
  * residential electricity per person: kWh/person
  * oil cunsumption: t/y/person
  * co2emissions t/y
  * income $/person
* 4-Secondary Question: *is urban population associated with energy types (oil vs electricity)*
* 5-oil vs electricity, wealth vs energy
* 6-literature
  * CO2 emissions, economic growth, energy consumption, trade and urbanization in new EU member and candidate countries: A panel data analysis
    * Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis
    * inverted U-shaped relationship between environment and income
  * China's Growing CO2 EmissionsA Race between Increasing Consumption and Efficiency Gains
    * how changes in China's technology, economic structure, urbanization, and lifestyles affect CO2 emissions
  * An Econometric Analysis for CO2 Emissions, Energy Consumption, Economic Growth, Foreign Trade and Urbanization of Japan
    * trade openness and urbanization the environmental quality is found to be normal good in the long-run
  * Causal relationship between CO2 emissions, real GDP, energy consumption, financial development, trade openness, and urbanization in Tunisia
    * positive monotonic relationship between real GDP and CO2 emissions
    * do not support the validity of environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis
  * Does urbanization lead to less energy use and lower CO2 emissions? A cross-country analysis
    * findings suggest that the impact of urbanization on energy use and emissions varies across the stages of development
    *  impact of urbanization on emissions is positive for all the income groups
* 7-hypothesis:
  * urbanization promotes energy efficiency (controlled for wealth effects)
